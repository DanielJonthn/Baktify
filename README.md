# 🎵 Baktify

## 📚 Project Overview

**Baktify** is a music-themed web application built using **Laravel** as part of our **Web Programming course project**.  
The concept, features, and UI were provided by our college in the form of a project brief (Microsoft Word document), and our task was to develop a fully functional website based on those requirements.

This repository represents our first hands-on experience with full-stack development using Laravel, focusing on applying concepts like **MVC architecture**, **routing**, **Blade templating**, and **CRUD operations** in a collaborative setting.
